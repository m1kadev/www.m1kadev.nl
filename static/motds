"what do you think success is?", asked the boy <br> "to love", said the mole # from "the boy, the mole, the fox and the horse", by charlie mackesy
let's go down to the bandstand on the pier / watch the drunks and lovers appear # from "sovereign light cafe", by keane, on the album strangeland
just buy cool things, you'll be 30 before you know it # thrift store employee, in spijkenisse, the netherlands
words are very unneccecary / they can only do harm # "enjoy the silence", by depeche mode, on violator
and all the fears you hold so dear / will turn to whisper in your ear # "duvet" by bôa, on twilight
when routine bites hard and ambitions are low # "love will tear us apart" by joy division, on the single of the same name
